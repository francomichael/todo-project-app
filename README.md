# Welcome to My To Do App project.


This is a simple To Do app project that allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses local storage to store the tasks.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/francomichael/todo-project-app.git
Once you've cloned the repository, you can open the index.html file in your web browser to use the app.

Usage
The To Do app allows you to create tasks by entering a task name and clicking the "Add Task" button. You can then mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox next to the task, or delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.

You can also edit a task by clicking the "Edit" button next to the task. This will open a modal window where you can edit the task name and click the "Save Changes" button to save your changes.

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the project, feel free to submit a pull request. However, please note that this project is intended as a learning exercise and is not actively maintained.
